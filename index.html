        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

        "After many years as an EMT, I was looking to transition into a new career and heard outstanding feedback about Publiq. I joined the company and found the experience to be both challenging and incredibly rewarding. The first 12 weeks were particularly intense but provided a strong foundation for my new career path. Since then, I’ve successfully made the transition and am excited about the professional growth and opportunities at Publiq."

        "Before joining the Geekster, I had no experience in coding and needed a structured approach to learn programming. Encouraged by a former student’s glowing recommendation, I decided to enroll. The program’s curriculum was thorough and well-structured, providing step-by-step instruction with exceptional support from the staff. The agile team project was a standout feature, offering practical, real-world experience that went beyond traditional tutorials. This project not only enhanced my learning but also became a key example in interviews. It significantly contributed to my ability to secure multiple job offers. Ultimately, I landed a role as a full-stack developer, thanks to the skills and experience gained from this bootcamp. I highly recommend this program for anyone looking to build a strong foundation in tech."
